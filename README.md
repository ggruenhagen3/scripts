# Scripts Used in the Streelman Lab
## Introduction
These scripts can be used to auto-generate and call pbs scripts on Georgia Tech's PACE server. While these scripts are used in the Streelman lab on cichlid genomes, the scripts are flexible enough to work with any genome.

## Variant Calling
This folder contains scripts used for variant calling, which is used to identify variants (i.e. single-nucleotide-polymorphisms, indels, and structural differences) from the reference sequence.

## Fst
This folder contains scripts to calculate and visual Fst scores, which can be helpful in determing genetic differences in populations.
