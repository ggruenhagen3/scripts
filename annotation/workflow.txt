Unbinned:
1. Annotate a vcf file (remember that Mzebra in the command is the name of the database not the folder)
2. Find the Fst the for the vcf file without binning
3. Use the awk command in "raw_annotation_to_coord_id.txt" to only keep necessary info
4. Edit "FST.SQL.txt" to include the annotation file and the fst file
5. Use this command 'sqlite3 fst.db < FST.SQL.txt > FST.txt' to find the genes that meet the threshold Fst value you set in FST.SQL.txt (might have to use 'rm fst.db')
6. Use this command 'python findGenes.py -a FST.txt -t ../../MZ_treefam_annot_umd2a.bash -o annIDs3.txt -p treefamIDs3.txt' to get the HGNC IDs.

Binned:
1. Find the fst for the vcf file with binning
2. Use the awk command in "keep_high_10kb.txt" to only keep the 10kb regions that are above an Fst threshold of your choosing
3. Use the awk command in "raw_annotation_to_coord_id.txt" to only keep necessary info
4. Use the awk command in "annot_to_bed.txt" to put the file you created in (3) into a bed format for bedtools
5. Use this command 'bedtools intersect -a snps_high_10kb.bed -b snps_coord_id.bed > intersect.bed' to find the genes that lie in the high 10kb regions
6. Use this command 'sqlite3 fst.db < FST_BIN.SQL.txt > FST.txt' to find the id of the closest genes to these variants (might have to use 'rm fst.db')
7. Use this command 'python findGenes.py -a FST.txt -t ../../MZ_treefam_annot_umd2a.bash -o annIDs3.txt -p treefamIDs3.txt' to get the HGNC IDs of the genes
